Challenge:
Write an algorithm to solve a random maze. Your program should accept two inputs (width/height) each being a positive integer.
Launch the maze.server application and call the commands endpoint (localhost:3002) to move through the maze, on each command you will be given:

-tile = an array of directions for your current location (up/down/left/right), where 0 = wall and 1 = floor (example [0,1,1,0] means there is a wall facing up and left, and floor facing right and down)
-player = your position and a flag to notify you if you have solved the maze
-start = starting co-ordinates on the maze
-finish = the position you must reach to solve the maze

Each call to the commands endpoint costs a turn, the aim is to complete the maze in the fewest turns. You may NOT call start more than once.

There are additional endpoints to give you the full maze, these are for testing and are forbidden for your final programme.

See README.md on server for more information on how to launch it and what the endpoints do.

All submitted programmes will be tested on 3 random mazes (of random square sizes), fewest total turns wins.
